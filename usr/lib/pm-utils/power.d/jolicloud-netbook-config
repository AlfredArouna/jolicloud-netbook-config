# This script makes anacron jobs start/stop when a machine gets or
# looses AC power.

# The /etc/init.d/anacron script now normally tries to avoid running
# anacron unless on AC power, so as to avoid running down the battery.
# (Things like the slocate updatedb cause a lot of IO.)  Rather than
# trying to second-guess which events reflect having or not having
# power, we just try to run anacron every time and let it abort if
# there's no AC.  You'll see a message on the cron syslog facility 
# (typically /var/log/cron) if it does run.
