# Configuration file for jolicloud-netbook-config

# If the cpufreq module is loaded (i.e., p4_clockmod) then some overly
# conservative polices are set on the EeePC. (Such as "ondemand" and
# default 100Mhz.) Sure, the result is 8hrs battery time but its VERY slow.
# These options configure more realistic values. For more info see
# cpufreq-info and cpufreq-set
